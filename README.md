# Algebra-1-Calculator
This is an Algebra 1 calculator I coded during my sophomore year. The idea to create it came from my freshman year, when I first started coding and discovered my passion for math. I named the calculator after my Algebra 1 teacher, who really inspired me to explore both algebra and coding. She encouraged me to combine my skills in programming with my growing interest in mathematics. This calculator is designed to help solve problems typically found in an Algebra 1 course.
